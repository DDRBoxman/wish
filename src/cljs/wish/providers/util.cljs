; lazy resolve to avoid circular dependencies;
; we need to know if a keyword is a provider-id for, eg checking if a
; keyword value is a sheet ID in subs-util, but all sorts of things depend
; on subscriptionsâ€”including wish.providers (indirectly) so to prevent
; circular dependencies, we resolve it (and memoize the result) at runtime.
; We *could* just hard-code the provider IDs here, but that duplication
; seems unnecessarily dumb
