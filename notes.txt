* ======= 5e Spellcasting ==================================

Because multiclassing spellcasters have their own separate
table spell slots table, spell slots are added to a class
using the :5e/spellcasting attribute, which accepts:

{:cantrips []  ; sequence of level, cantrips gained at that level
 :slots  ; spellslots table, either a map of class level -> {spell level -> slots}
         ; or one of the keywords:  :standard, :standard/half
         ; where the latter is for rangers and paladins
 :multiclass-levels-mod 2  ; number by which to devide class level when
                           ; determining multiclass spellcaster level.
                           ; Default is just 1; rangers/paladins are 2
 :slots-type :id  ; if non-standard (like Warlock) this should be a
                  ; namespace-less keyword
 :slots-label "Label"  ; if :slots-type is provided, this should also
                       ; be provided
 :restore-trigger :long-rest  ; :long-rest is the default
 :ability :wis  ; base ability for spellcasting modifier
 :acquires? false  ; whether the class acquires spells before preparing them. This is
                   ; sort of a special case for Wizards. If True, the :spells list
                   ; is used to select :acquired spells, and, if the class :prepares?
                   ; then it instead prepares from the :acquired-spells list (it is
                   ; sort of assumed that if a class acquires they also prepare, but
                   ; you should set the flag anyway).
                   ; Futhermore, for an :acquires? spellcaster, cantrips, once known,
                   ; are always prepared.
 :prepares? true  ; Whether the class prepares spells or just knows them
 :known [table]  ; Vector that determines how many spells can be known or prepared
                 ; at a given level (where the first index in the table is level 1).
                 ; If not provided, :slots MUST be either :standard or :standard/half.
                 ; Bard and Ranger in particular use a standard spellslot table, but
                 ; have a distinct table of known spells. If NO spells are known at a
                 ; level (such as for the Arcane Trickster) 0 can be used.

 :spells :<class>/spells  ; id of a feature whose selected options provide available
                          ; spells (or known spells for an :acquires? spellcaster)
 :extra-spells :<class>/extra-spells  ; id of a list of spells that are always
                                      ; available, such as a cleric's domain spells.
 :acquired-label "Spellbook"  ; label for the :acquired-spells list
 :acquires?-spells :<class>/acquires  ; id of a feature whose selected options provide
                                      ; available spells for an :acquires? spellcaster.
 }

Note that preparing vs knowing is really just a visual treatment.
The actual spell selection is provided by a feature

* ======= Racial spellcasting ==============================

Every class can support a racial spells list that a Racial Spell
feature would add to
